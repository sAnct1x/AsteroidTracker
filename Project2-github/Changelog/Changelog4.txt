Changelog - Pass 4: Robust API Parsing Fix

* **Fixed API Parsing Error:** Corrected the `AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'` in the `try_fetch_sbdb_elements` function.
* **Identified Root Cause:** The error was not that the 'orbit' object was a list, but that the 'elements' data *within* the orbit was a list of key-value dictionaries (e.g., [{"name": "a", "value": "1.23"}, ...]) instead of a simple dictionary.
* **Implemented Solution:**
    * The function now correctly parses this list of elements.
    * It first converts this list into a standard Python dictionary.
    * A new helper function, `get_float`, was added to safely extract and convert numerical values from this new dictionary, correctly handling `None` or missing keys.
* **Added Validation:** A final check now verifies that the six essential orbital elements (a, e, i, om, w, ma) were successfully parsed. If not, the function returns `None` and prints an error, preventing downstream crashes.
